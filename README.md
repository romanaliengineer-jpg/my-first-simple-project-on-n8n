# my-first-project-n8n


This project is my first automation built with n8n, where I created an AI chat workflow that fetches and processes responses from the Gemini API.

The workflow demonstrates:

Connecting n8n with an external AI API (Gemini)

Sending user input to the AI model

Receiving and handling AI-generated responses

Understanding JSON data flow inside n8n

Building a basic AI-powered chat automation

This project helped me learn the fundamentals of n8n workflows, API integration, and AI automation.
